  Our security guard claims that the building wasn't vandalised while he was on duty because of this image, dated at midnight when his shift ended. However, the next security guard said that the building was vandalised when he arrived. Can you figure out what time this photo was genuinely taken within an hour of the actual time, given that it was taken on the night between the 23rd and 24th of June, 2025 somewhere close to Castle Hill.

  Note: Please enter a 24 hour time in the following format without using the word SCONES: `HH:mm`. For example, if you think it was taken at 3:42 AM, please enter `03:42`. If the actual time was 4:41 AM, your flag would be accepted.
